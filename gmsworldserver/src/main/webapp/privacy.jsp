                            <b>How we protect your information</b><br/><br/>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage
                            and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration,
                            disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction
                            information and data stored on our Site.<br/><br/>Sensitive and private data exchange between

                            protected with digital signatures.<br/><br/>
                            <b>Sharing your personal information</b><br/><br/>
                            We do not sell, trade, or rent Users personal identification information to others. We may
                            share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification
                            information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and
                            advertisers for the purposes outlined above.<br/><br/>
                            <b>Third party websites</b><br/><br/>
                            Users may find advertising or other content on our Site that link to the sites and services
                            of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We
                            do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and are not responsible for
                            the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site. In addition, these sites or
                            services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These sites and
                            services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and
                            interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site, is
                            subject to that website's own terms and policies.<br/><br/>
                            <b>Advertising</b><br/><br/>
                            Ads appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may
                            set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time
                            they send you an online advertisement to compile non personal identification information
                            about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to,
                            among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                            interest to you. This privacy policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br/><br/>
                            <b>Google Adsense</b><br/><br/>Some of the ads may be served by Google.
                            Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Users based on their visit to our
                            Site and other sites on the Internet. DART uses "non personally identifiable information" and
                            does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical
                            address, etc. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and
