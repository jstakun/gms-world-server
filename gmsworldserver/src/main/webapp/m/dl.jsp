    	<h3>Device Locator  commands</h3>
    	
    	In order to get some commands to work on your device you'll need to grant number of permissions in the application.
    	In addition to SMS commands starting from Device Locator 0.4 you can send messages directly from Device Locator to other registered device with Device Locator installed using our cloud messaging system.  
    	In order to execute command on remote device with Device Locator installed you need to send following SMS message: 
    	
    	<p><b>&lt;command&gt;&lt;security pin&gt; &lt;optional parameters&gt;</b></p>
    	
    	<b>Security PIN</b> is generated by Device Locator during application installation and you can find it and change it at any time on Security PIN card. Security PIN must be at least 4 digits. <font color="red">Remember to protect your PIN!</font><br/><br/>
